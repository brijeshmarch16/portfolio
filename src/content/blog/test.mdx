# Building this portfolio

Welcome to the blog section of my site. Here I write about what I am learning and building in public.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js App Router**, modern CSS tooling, and a component-first approach.

## Why I built this portfolio

```
const WhyIBuiltThisPortfolio = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Why I built this portfolio</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```
